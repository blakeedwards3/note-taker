# Note Taker
A note taker application that is used to write and save notes in a database.

## Description

This challenge was to create a web application where you can create and store notes in one database to easily keep track of your daily tasks and reminders of things that need to be done. This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js to make the magic happen!
